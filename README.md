## Requirements
To clone this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and to run this application you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer before you start. 

## To Use
First you need to either clone this git, or download as zip and extract the contents to a folder of your choosing. To clone the git via command line, use this command:
```bash

```bash
cd barebones-express-ejs

Finally, you will need to install the dependancies. To do this, enter the following command into the command promt:
```bash
npm install
